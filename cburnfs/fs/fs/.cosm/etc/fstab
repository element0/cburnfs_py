# # Cosm / Etc / FSTab

# the .cosm/etc/fstab used by cburn is shared between hosts. The concept of 'localhost' is centric to a generic host model. A file url is relative to the generic host model, whereas a relative file path is relative to the working directory of cloudburner at runtime on each host.

# experimental: include a hostname in the 'file://' url to limit the scope of a filepath to a specific host.

# experimental: proxy the 'file' protocol and allow subdomain syntax to specify shares. The path component is relative to the share.

# idea: make filepaths relative to the fstab's location, ie: for ./.cosm/etc/fstab the relative root is ../../../

# mntopt nouser keeps the mountpoint out of the user interface and should be used for the ui overlay only.
