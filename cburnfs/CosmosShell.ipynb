    "\n",
    "The Cosmos Shell python object `CosmosShell` wraps an `APath` Access Path object. The shell uses the Access Path as a context to execute commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cosmos type-system has commands like `new` which create a file system object from a type template.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Paths vs. APath Location\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, a target path may be specified like `/a/b/c.typename`. A CosmosShell operates only on one segment of a path. The path lookup mechanism can use CosmosShell to execute commands in each lookup step, in the context of each path segment, the resulting `APath` object for `/a/b/` would issue a command `new` to create `c.typename`. This command would run in a CosmosShell wrapping the `/a/b/` APath. The pathname value of the APath would be `/a/b/` and the new target directory entry pathname would be `/a/b/c.typename` so the target pathname could be pattern matched with a type-match of `*.typename`. However, it must be noted that the actual execution environment of the CosmosShell is the APath for `/a/b/`, and not `/`.\n",
